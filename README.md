# Goals

1.  Track how your time is spent
2.  "Trick" yourself into getting the things you want done, done
3.  Stop wasting time buried in distractions and procrastinations

<br/>

## Motivation for creating this

1.  I have found that this system has been enormously successful as a motivation tool
    *   It does follow various guidelines set out in psychological literature
2.  I wanted to be able to access it from any computer
3.  I wanted to allow others to give it a shot and maybe it is a useful organization strategy for you too

<br/>

## The Trick

The _reason_ it works is that via some very simple data analysis,
you can **see** the effect your procrastination is having on your
ability to do the things you actually want. But I haven't implemented
the graphing tools yet so hold your horses. If you want a sneak preview
of the vision, check out:

# How To

1.  Group your tasks into categories (e.g. for a student, each class might be a different category)
2.  Fill the tasks into your categories (e.g. a homework assignment might be a task)
3.  If it's useful, add subtasks to the tasks that have substantial subcomponents
4.  Sit for an **extended period of time** solely focused on accomplishing your task
5.  Record the time spent _actually_ focused (obviously cheating just defeats the purpose)
6.  Do this **every time** you work on one of your tasks

<br/>

## Become obsessive but be picky

*   **Only track** the things that really matter to you
*   **Obsessively track** the things that really matter to you
*   The point here is to **quantify** the time you spend doing the things that really matter to you
*   This way you can **know** that you are accomplishing your goal of **increasing/decreasing**
        the time you spend doing the things that really matter to you
